# Grade_Predictor
I have successfully developed my inaugural full-stack website, featuring a regression-based machine learning model. This model accurately predicts the minimum marks required to achieve your desired grade in courses with relative grading systems.

The integration of the machine learning model with HTML was accomplished using the Python Flask library. Additionally, I have hosted the website on AWS Cloud, making it publicly accessible via a temporary URL. Feel free to contact me if you would like access to the public link of the webpage.
